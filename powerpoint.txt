Advice on PowerPoint

One slide per minute and one minute per minute
Have a title slide
For short presentations, omit a table of contents or agenda
Don't get carried away with PowerPoint bells and whistles
Make your slides readable at a distance so 24 point fonts, may need larger
Don't fill the slides with text
Use pictures where appropriate but they too must be readable and be aware that projectors can mess your colours up

Before giving the presentation, rehearse what you will say, so you don't have to refer to notes

When giving the presentation:
Speak clearly
Do not mumble, or gabble
Stick to the time allotted
Use your slides to talk around the topic, rather than just reading what's there or reading your notes
